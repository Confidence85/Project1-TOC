## Overview

This project implements a brute-force for the Graph Coloring problem.

## Running the Project
python main.py 
-uses graph_test.cnf file to test code, and stores results in a csv file in the results folder.
-I made a more advanced test file named graph_test2.cnf in the input folder so as to check my work. In order to run it and see the results in the csv file you have to change the input file in constraints.py
